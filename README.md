> ## Bridging R with ArcGIS - _Examples_

### Using R as a scripting tool to generate geostatistical tools for ArcGIS to work with.

- This Repository has two tools as of now meant for kriging - One is for Ordinary kriging while the other is Universal kriging tool.
- The Ordinary kriging tool simply interpolates the values.
- The Universal kriging tool uses a covariate [sqrt(dist)] to interpolate the values.
